#User Experience Design Resources

Following on from the  user experience design (UXD) Workshop the following list of resources should help you develop your next Interim User Experience Report. Beyond that this material will prove invaluable to your development as a designer.

We covered a broad range of skills, techniques and approaches involved with UXD. these included:

###Sketching
> "Sketchbooks are not about being a good artist, they are 
> about being a good thinker.”  Jason Santa Maria.

You do not have to be a great artist to get your point across. Often sketches will be for your eyes only and just need to get ideas down quickly whereas others may need to be a little more refined to allow you to take others through your ideas. Either way you do not have to be Da Vinci to get something down on paper. If you need a little help in this department [Sketching User Experiences: The Workbook][8] may offer a little guidance. Taking your ideas across a wider surface with sketchboards will allow you to plan things more fully.

**Personas** will help you to develop a personality for your project but you should also consider who your typical user might be and ensure your site fits their needs. MailChimps Director of User Experience, Aarron Walter looked at personas in [Connected UX][9] on A List Apart.

**Design principles** will not only help you develop a personality for your project but it will allow you to create a set of standards with which to stand by. Jeremy Keith has created an excellent list of [Design Principles.][10]

**Design Pattern Libraries** can be an invaluable resource, it will save you time on repetitive tacks and allow you to build up a set of templates and stencils that suits your style. Paul Boag looks at [How and why to create a pattern library.][11] Notable pattern libraries include – [MailChip][12], [BBC][13] and [The Next Web.][14]

###User Journeys
The workshop looked at user journeys asking you to consider the pathway people will have to take to reach their goal. Amazon for example make the process of purchasing goods as simple as possible to ensure you are met with a seamless journey from finding what you want, adding it to your shopping cart and checking out. 

The UX Review provides a useful [User Journeys – The Beginner’s Guide.][20]to set you on the right path.

We looked at a couple of journeys on websites which offer the same services comparing how each tackled the tasks

Comparing a user journey through your project to similar sites or services can prove invaluable.
